### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm 34 years old and have a passion for coding, design and development.
Since I've been a Front End student for the last 4 years, my main focus has naturally been on Front End.
The studies are soon finished and I look forward to building by tool box and skills further.

I really enjoy working with React and Next.js, but I'm planning on contributing on some open source projects.
So far I haven't worked with others, so I think that's the clever ting to do.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently a student at Noroff (Front End) 
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on an open source project

Here's my portfolio page: https://www.thor-erik.no/
